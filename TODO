  in the .jregr can be followed wherever Jregr was run from
☐ Handle piping of output? We do input... (" < " so should we support " > "?)

☐ Place any error output in the .output, if already done, why does not "<bin> not found" show up there?
☐ Remove any non-XML-compliant characters when generating XML-file
✔ An empty .jregr file means the content is inherited from directory above
✔ Remove possible directory separator at end of -dir option
✔ Recurse through directories, only follow directories that have .jregr files.
✔ A top level directory should always have a .jregr file
✔ Remove source to set file encoding @done(18-12-30 12:30)
✔ Document java option -Dfile.encoding= @done(18-12-30 12:30)
